- write your answers in solution.js

## 1. Run Along
Create a `while` loop that runs as long as the variable `i` is less than 15. Print `i`.
- start with `i = 0`

## 2. Add it up 
Create a `while` loop which sums up numbers from 1 to (including) 20.  Thus, your `while` loop "automatically" calculates `1+2+3...+20`.

## 3. Do this while i...
Use a `do...while` loop to print `The number is [i]` while `i` is less than 20.
- start with `k = 0`
